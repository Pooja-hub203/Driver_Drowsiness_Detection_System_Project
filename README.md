# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_System_Project

Key Skills: 
  1. Python
  2. SQL
  3. Real-time dataset
  4. OpenCV
  5. PyGame
  6. Data Visualization
     
The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a
person's eyes are closed for a few seconds. This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Tools Required and Platform used:
    1. Python : Python code is used to build the system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds.
       We use Scipy, Pandas and NumPy libraries.
    2. Machine learning : Machine learning is the kind of programming which gives computers the capability to
       automatically learn from data without being explicitly programmed.
    3. MySQL : database connection
    4. OpenCV : face and eye detection
    5. Pygame : to play alarm sound
    6. Realtime dataset
